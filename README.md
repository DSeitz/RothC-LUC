# RothC-LUC

Welcome to the official repo for the RothC-LUC model that was tested and described in Seitz et al (2025). The model is a modification of the RothC model described in Coleman & Jenkinson (1996). RothC-LUC is implemented in R and C++ and uses the SoilR package by Sierra et al. (2012). This repo includes scripts needed to run the model, and the artificial data-set described in Seitz et al (2025) with modelling results from all 3 tested versions of RothC.
